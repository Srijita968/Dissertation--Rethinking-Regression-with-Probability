# Dissertation-Rethinking Regression with Probability
Comparative study of Classical Linear Regression and Bayesian Regression through theoretical foundations and applied datasets. Demonstrates uncertainty modeling, credible intervals, forensic age estimation, and predictive analysis using probabilistic learning frameworks.
# Regression: The Classical and Bayesian Paradigm

## Overview
This dissertation presents a comparative analytical study between Classical Linear Regression and Bayesian Regression, highlighting their theoretical foundations, inferential frameworks, uncertainty handling, and predictive performance across structured and real-world datasets.

## Objectives
- Explain the statistical foundations of Linear Regression
- Develop Bayesian regression models using prior and posterior reasoning
- Compare frequentist vs probabilistic inference approaches
- Evaluate performance across forensic and predictive datasets
- Analyse uncertainty through confidence and credible intervals

## Methodological Coverage

### Classical Regression
- Least Squares Estimation
- Hypothesis Testing & p-values
- Residual Standard Error (RSE)
- R² and Correlation Interpretation
- BMI vs Blood Sugar predictive modelling

### Bayesian Framework
- Prior → Likelihood → Posterior
- Parameter uncertainty modelling
- Equal-tail & HPD Credible Intervals
- Bayesian inference for SBP prediction
- Sequential updating and probabilistic learning

## Comparative Case Studies

### 1. Dental Age Estimation (Forensic Dataset)
- CA + Linear Regression fails to model discrete maturity stages  
- Bayesian classification achieves perfect predictive accuracy  
- Demonstrates advantage of probabilistic modeling in categorical uncertainty

### 2. NFL Playoff Probability Prediction
- Classical regression assumes linear trends across weeks  
- Bayesian Ridge incorporates uncertainty & regularization
- Both Linear Regression and Bayesian Ridge failed to accurately predict playoff probability when week number was used as the sole predictor. This highlights the limitation of weak feature spaces and demonstrates that probabilistic models cannot compensate for missing explanatory variables in complex real-world systems.
- Highlights robustness in predictive sports analytics

##  Key Insights
- Classical regression is interpretable but assumption-dependent  
- Bayesian regression provides stronger inference under uncertainty  
- Prior information significantly improves predictive reliability  
- Probabilistic modelling is essential for real-world, noisy datasets
